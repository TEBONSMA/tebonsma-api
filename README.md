# tebonsma-api

Small HTTP API that lets members logged in on tebonsma.no view and edit their own account
in LLDAP. The site's `/konto` page uses it.

## How it works

- **Who is calling:** clients send the access token from their OIDC login as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The API asks the provider's userinfo endpoint who the
  token belongs to (`preferred_username`) and caches the answer for 60 seconds.
- **What it changes:** that user's own entry in LLDAP, through LLDAP's GraphQL API, logged
  in as a service account. The account being changed always comes from the token, never
  from the request body.
- **What it won't change:** only display name, first and last name, and profile picture
  are editable. Email is left alone because it doubles as the mail login, and passwords
  are changed through the login provider.

| Method | Path | Does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |
| GET | `/me` | Own profile: username, email, names, avatar, groups |
| PATCH | `/me` | Update `displayName`, `firstName`, `lastName` |
| PUT | `/me/avatar` | Set profile picture, body `{ "image": "<base64 JPEG>" }`, max 512 KB |
| DELETE | `/me/avatar` | Remove profile picture |

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.18 or newer, which runs the TypeScript sources directly (no build step), or Docker.
- An OIDC provider whose userinfo endpoint returns `preferred_username`, and optionally
  `groups`. Tested with Authelia 4.39.
- LLDAP 0.6 or newer, with a service account in the `lldap_admin` group. Admin rights are
  needed to edit other users' entries.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLDAP_USERNAME` | required | Service account username |
| `LLDAP_PASSWORD` | required | Service account password |
| `LLDAP_URL` | `http://lldap:17170` | LLDAP's HTTP address |
| `OIDC_USERINFO_URL` | `https://auth.tebonsma.no/api/oidc/userinfo` | Where tokens are checked |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://tebonsma.no` | Comma-separated sites allowed to call the API (CORS) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port to listen on |

Put the credentials in `.env` (see `.env.example`). It is git-ignored and should never be
committed.

## Running with Docker Compose

1. In LLDAP, create the service account and add it to `lldap_admin`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the password.
3. Check `docker-compose.yaml`. It joins an existing Docker network (`lldap_default`) so it
   can reach LLDAP by container name, and sets the URLs for tebonsma.no. Change these to
   match your setup.
4. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

The container doesn't publish a port. Put it behind a reverse proxy or tunnel that serves
it over HTTPS. The image has a healthcheck on `/health`.

To update, get the new code in place and run `docker compose up -d --build` again. `.env`
is left untouched.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
```

Set the variables from the table in your shell, then start it. It restarts on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

`npm run typecheck` checks types without running anything.

## Security

- The service account is an LLDAP admin, so keep `.env` private. The API only exposes the
  self-service endpoints above; don't add endpoints that act on other users.
- Any valid access token from the OIDC provider is accepted, so only register clients
  there that you trust.
