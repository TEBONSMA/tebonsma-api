# tebonsma-api

Small HTTP API for members logged in on tebonsma.no. It lets them view and edit their own
account in LLDAP (the site's `/konto` page) and keeps the scoreboard for the Flappy game.

## How it works

- **Who is calling:** clients send the access token from their OIDC login as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The API asks the provider's userinfo endpoint who the
  token belongs to (`preferred_username`) and caches the answer for 60 seconds.
- **What it changes:** that user's own entry in LLDAP, through LLDAP's GraphQL API, logged
  in as a service account. The account being changed always comes from the token, never
  from the request body.
- **What it won't change:** only display name, first and last name, and profile picture
  are editable. Email is left alone because it doubles as the mail login, and passwords
  are changed through the login provider.

| Method | Path | Does |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |
| GET | `/me` | Own profile: username, email, names, avatar, groups |
| PATCH | `/me` | Update `displayName`, `firstName`, `lastName` |
| PUT | `/me/avatar` | Set profile picture, body `{ "image": "<base64 JPEG>" }`, max 512 KB |
| DELETE | `/me/avatar` | Remove profile picture |
| POST | `/flappy/runs` | Start a game run, returns `{ "runId": "…" }` |
| POST | `/flappy/scores` | Submit a finished run, body `{ "runId": "…", "score": 12 }` |
| GET | `/flappy/leaderboard` | Top 5, plus the caller's own best and rank |

### Flappy scoreboard

Each member has one entry: their best score and the date they set it. The site fetches a
run ticket when a game starts and submits the score with it when the game ends. A ticket
can be used once, only by the member it was issued to, and the score has to be possible in
the time since the ticket was issued. The game gives at most one point per 100 steps at
60 steps per second. This stops casual cheating, not a determined player. Scores live in a
SQLite database in `DATA_DIR`.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.18 or newer, which runs the TypeScript sources directly (no build step), or Docker.
- An OIDC provider whose userinfo endpoint returns `preferred_username`, and optionally
  `groups`. Tested with Authelia 4.39.
- LLDAP 0.6 or newer, with a service account in the `lldap_admin` group. Admin rights are
  needed to edit other users' entries.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLDAP_USERNAME` | required | Service account username |
| `LLDAP_PASSWORD` | required | Service account password |
| `LLDAP_URL` | `http://lldap:17170` | LLDAP's HTTP address |
| `OIDC_USERINFO_URL` | `https://auth.tebonsma.no/api/oidc/userinfo` | Where tokens are checked |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://tebonsma.no` | Comma-separated sites allowed to call the API (CORS) |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port to listen on |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` (`/app/data` in Docker) | Folder for the SQLite database |

Put the credentials in `.env` (see `.env.example`). It is git-ignored and should never be
committed.

## Running with Docker Compose

1. In LLDAP, create the service account and add it to `lldap_admin`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the password.
3. Check `docker-compose.yaml`. It joins an existing Docker network (`lldap_default`) so it
   can reach LLDAP by container name, and sets the URLs for tebonsma.no. Change these to
   match your setup.
4. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

The container doesn't publish a port. Put it behind a reverse proxy or tunnel that serves
it over HTTPS. The image has a healthcheck on `/health`.

The scoreboard database is kept in the `data` volume, so it survives rebuilds. To back it
up, copy `tebonsma.db` out of that volume.

To update, get the new code in place and run `docker compose up -d --build` again. `.env`
and the data volume are left untouched.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
```

Set the variables from the table in your shell, then start it. It restarts on file changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

`npm run typecheck` checks types without running anything.

## Security

- The service account is an LLDAP admin, so keep `.env` private. The API only exposes the
  self-service endpoints above; don't add endpoints that act on other users.
- Any valid access token from the OIDC provider is accepted, so only register clients
  there that you trust.
